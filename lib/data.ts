    lyrics: `In the silence of the night
Where shadows dance and play
I find myself dreaming
Of worlds so far away

Through the cosmic dust we fly
Beyond the stars we roam
In search of something magical
A place to call our home

[Chorus]
Moonlit dreams, take me higher
Through the stars, light the fire
In my heart, burning bright
Guide me through this endless night`

    lyrics: `Waves crash upon the shore
Stories from the deep
Ancient tales of wonder
Secrets that they keep

Salt spray in the air
Freedom in the breeze
Following the current
Across the seven seas

[Chorus]
Hear the ocean's call
Rising with the tide
Nature's lullaby
Taking us for a ride`

    lyrics: `Standing tall against the sky
Peaks that touch the clouds
Ancient rocks and weathered paths
Where eagles soar so proud

Through the mist and morning dew
We climb our way up high
Finding strength in every step
Until we touch the sky

[Chorus]
Mountains calling, we must go
Where the wild winds blow
Higher, higher, we will climb
Where few dare to go`

    lyrics: `Leaves rustling in the breeze
Stories from the trees
Ancient wisdom flowing
Through the forest seas

Sunlight filters through
Dancing on the ground
Nature's secret symphony
Without a single sound

[Chorus]
Listen to the whispers
Of the forest deep
Sacred tales of old
That the trees still keep`
